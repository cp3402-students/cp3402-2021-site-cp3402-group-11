7. In relevant IDE customise the theme, making relevant version control commits, then push completed work to repository. Create relevant pull requests to main branch. Pull requests must be tested before merging to main branch.

8. Once the main branch is merged and updated with the changes, the repository can be pulled to local environment so as to be uploaded via zip file into the staging site via appearance/theme/add new, then activated to test in the staging website. After testing on the staging website is successful, the theme zip folder can be uploaded to the production site.
